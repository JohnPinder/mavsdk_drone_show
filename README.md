#  Folked Mavlink Drone Show
# MAVSDK Drone Show (MDS) – All-in-One Drone-Show & Smart Swarm Framework

MDS is a unified platform for PX4-based drone performances and intelligent swarm missions. Whether you want to run a pre-planned, decentralized drone show using SkyBrush outputs or orchestrate a live, collaborative swarm with leader–follower clustering (Kalman-filter enhanced, dynamic role changes, leader failover), MDS has you covered.

## Overview

MDS 3 combines three core components into a single, cohesive package:

1. **Drone Side**  
   - Runs on any Linux-based autopilot platform (e.g., Raspberry Pi, NVIDIA Jetson, or similar).  
   - Handles MAVSDK integration, local trajectory execution, failsafe monitoring, and dynamic formation logic.

2. **Cloud Side (Optional Backend)**  
   - Hosts the formation-planning engine, mission dispatcher, and WebSocket/MAVLink router.  
   - Provides global setpoint management, three-way startup handshake, and health-check services.  
   - Can be deployed on any cloud VM (Ubuntu 22.04 / 23.04 recommended) or on-premises server.

3. **Frontend (React Dashboard)**  
   - Full-featured React GUI for real-time monitoring and control.  
   - Upload offline “ShowMode” trajectories (CSV/JSON from SkyBrush), visualize live positions, assign leaders/followers, and trigger mission modes.  
   - Supports both Drone-Show mode (offline choreography) and Smart-Swarm mode (live clustering with Kalman filters, dynamic formation reshaping, and leader-failover).

In short, MDS 3 is **one package** that can be used for:
- **Offline Drone Shows**: Pre-planned, synchronized formations based on SkyBrush CSV outputs.
- **Smart Swarm Missions**: Cluster-based, fully decentralized leader–follower missions with robust failsafe handling, automatic leader re-election, and dynamic reconfiguration.

## Key Features

- **All-in-One Architecture**  
  - Shared Docker image and codebase for both offline shows and live swarm missions.  
  - Single command-line interface and unified React dashboard.

- **Offline Drone-Show Mode**  
  - Converts SkyBrush CSV/JSON into MAVSDK-compatible “ShowMode” files.  
  - Global setpoint propagation ensures perfect synchronization across 10–100+ SITL instances or real drones.  
  - Preflight sanity checks (battery, GPS lock, ESC health) before arming.

- **Smart Swarm Mode (Live, Decentralized)**  
  - Clustered leader–follower architecture with Kalman-filter–enhanced state estimation.  
  - Automatic leader failure detection and re-election based on configurable metrics (battery level, signal strength, drone ID).  
  - Dynamic formation reshaping and per-drone role changes on-the-fly.  
  - In-flight failsafe monitors communication timeouts, altimeter discrepancies, ESC reboots → automatic Return-to-Home or Loiter.

- **Stable Startup Handshake**  
  - Three-way acknowledgement chain (Drone ⇄ PX4, PX4 ⇄ MAVSDK, MAVSDK ⇄ GCS) to guarantee all SITL instances or hardware drones are ready before takeoff.  
  - “OK-to-Start” broadcast from the cloud backend prevents premature launches.

- **Robustness & Performance**  
  - Race-condition fixes under high CPU load (ensures correct GUIDED → AUTO transitions).  
  - Emergency-land command reliability during mode transitions.  
  - Network buffer tuning for large-scale simulations (100+ drones) using MAVLink Router.  

- **React Dashboard (Frontend)**  
  - Live position, battery, mode, and failsafe status for each drone.  
  - Mission upload interface for offline trajectories or real-time swarm commands.  
  - **3D Trajectory Planning** - Interactive waypoint creation with real terrain elevation, speed optimization, and professional trajectory management (requires Mapbox access token for full functionality).  
  - Formation editor (drag-and-drop) for offline shows (coming soon).  
  - REST API endpoints via MAVLink2REST for external integrations.

- **Automated Docker Environment**  
  - Prebuilt Docker image includes PX4 1.16, MAVSDK Drone Show, MAVLink Router, MAVLink2REST, Gazebo, and all SITL dependencies.  
  - Auto hardware-ID detection and dynamic container creation scripts.

- **Mission Configuration Tools**  
  - SkyBrush CSV → MDS template converter script.  
  - JSON-based mission/formation files with built-in validators.  
  - Parameter‐tuning utilities for leader election thresholds, Kalman filter gains, and failsafe timeouts.
